Author's Thoughts:
- I initially disliked web-development. But after sitting down, and patiently attempting to tackle a simple project, made me realize that the way I was introduced to Web-Development was sub-optimal. 
- Only after completing a mini-project (i timed myself) did I realize hwo fun, rewarding and intuitive Web Dev is. 
- Especially working with JavaScript. That was the part I enjoyed the most. 
- Web Dev requires a lot of patience and debugging. One wrong syntax error, one bug, and it can take a LONG time to figure out that error. Especially when the error stares at you in the face. #ConstantVigilence #SimplestThingsAreTheHardest
